generally, use dijkstra or A* to determine path to go
there should be a priority weighting that shfits over the term of the game
so at the start, place more aggressive walsl tos low the enemy down but don;takeuse all of your walls
make sure that when placing walls, you maximize enemy time to leave via blocking and full optimization over all possibilities near the enemy

also, check every turn if you are prone to being blocked. this should be 
a lower priority at the start that slowly gets higher. if you are in 
an area with two exits and one is logner than the other, block the long exits
this should really be the only defensive walls you should place, as you 
cannot block the enemy completely, so now they can' tbock your path.

in general, make sure to find a balance between aggressive awlls at the 
first coupole moves, making sure to get tempo and move over the enemy, and
sparsingly placing defensive walls when absolutely necessary.

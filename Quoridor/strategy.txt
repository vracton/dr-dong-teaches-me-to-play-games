generally, use dijkstra or A* 

every single turn check if you are prone to being blocked via another dijksta to see how many open paths you have based on walls (not on first move)

then from there you block their blockage of the longer path so you can go the hsorter path

and then also every move you do another calculation to see the enemy's position and run 
maybe a local greedy search of some kind to find a wall to maximize the amount of movecs it would take to surpass the wall

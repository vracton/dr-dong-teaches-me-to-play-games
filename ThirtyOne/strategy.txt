if starting hand value 20+, knock

if you start with a face card of a suit, try playing for that suit
if you don't start with a face card, play for whatever suit you have most points in
until you either see a face ceard in discard pile, get a face card from the draw pile, or if the discard pile
gives you a higher score than what suit you are currently playing for (unless the suit has a face card already that
is in ur hand if ykwim)


keep track of opponents recently picked suits in a list from discard pile along with the values they picked up
to ahave a guess at their score


draw strategy: 
	a face card is a normal face card (king, queen, jack) or an ace
	
	if you have a face card in your hand:
		only pick from discard pile if it is the suit you are playing for AND would deliver a 
		higher value than what you currently have of that suit in your hand. otherwise, pick from 
		the draw pile

		if discard pile card is a face card: 
			if it gives you a higher value in another suit than your current suit, pick it
			otherwise if it is your current suit, also pick it
			otherwise if it doesn't give you a higher value than your current suit, pick from draw pile

	if you don't have a face card in your hand: 
		pick from discard pile if it would give a higher point value in any suit than you currently have in your hand

	DO NOT IMPLEMENT THIS RN IMPLEMENT THIS LATER 
	also consider if opponent has picked up 2 face cards of your suit:
		switch suits to second highest


	KNOCK STRATEGY:
		if >= 26 knock

		

discard strategy: 
	find the point value per suit in your hand with 4 cards 
	if you have a face card suit in your hand: 
		if there is another face card that is not your current suit:
			if the value of that suit is higher than your current suit:
				change your suit to that suit
				discard the lowest rank card amongst the suits you are not playing
			elif value is not higher:
				discard the lowest rank card amongst the suits you are not playing
		else if there is not another face card:
			discard the lowest rank card amongst the suits you are not playing
			TODO: CONSIDER TROLLING BY DROPPPING A SUIT UR PLAYING SO ENEMIES DON'T KNOW UR SUIT

		else:
			discard the lowest rank card that isn't that suit
